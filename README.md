# Machine-Learning-100
 frequent questions in machine learning
 this book is written after I withdraw my position in first job
 
 the major reasons that i create this project are:
 1. help junior to enter machine learning world
 2. strengthen my understanding in machine learning (once you can tell people in easy way, you mastered the knowledge)
 3. make some contribution to industry and world, advance the knowledge exchange
 4. make machine learning friendly to each others
 5. for fun, haha


this project will be continuously updated until i lost the interest of machine learning. so, enjoy!
